# DiffEqParamEstim.jl

DiffEqParamEstim.jl is a component package in the DifferentialEquations ecosystem. It holds the
parameter estimation tools. While completely independent
and usable on its own, users interested in using this
functionality should check out [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl).

## Installation

This functionality does not come standard with DifferentialEquations.jl.
To use this functionality, you must install DiffEqParamEstim.jl:

```julia
]add DiffEqParamEstim
using DiffEqParamEstim
```
